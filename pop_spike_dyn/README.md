This repository contains different methods for linear dynamical system models with Poisson observations. It has been developed and implemented with the goal of modelling spike-train recordings from neural populations, but at least some of the methods will be applicable more generally. 

In particular, the repository includes methods for

* Laplace approximation for state-inference
* Variational inference for the state
* Expectation maximisation for parameter learning, using Laplace or Variation inference
* Nuclear-norm minimisation (as described in Pfau et al.)
* Exponential family PCA
* Nonlinear Subspace Identification (SSID) (core code available at http://bitbucket.org/larsbuesing/ssidforplds)
